**&lt;runtime&gt;-mandlebrot** - This example renders a 80x80 Mandlebrot
set to the serial output as ascii art, shading each pixel based on the
number of iterations until divergence, up until 100 iterations.

It's a good showcase of floating-point operations in a tight loop.

More info in the [README.md](/README.md).
