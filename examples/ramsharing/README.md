**ramsharing** - A minimal example where multiple boxes share RAM.

By marking boxes as `idempotent` and assigning overlapping RAM regions,
bento-boxes automatically brings up/down boxes as needed. However,
idempotent boxes do not preserve state when this happens.

More info in the [README.md](/README.md).
